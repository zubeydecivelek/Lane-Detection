## Description
Lane Detection using Hough Transform - A computer vision project for BBM 418 - Computer Vision Laboratory, Spring 2022-2023. This project implements edge detection methods and the Hough Transform to detect lanes in images from a subset of the CULane dataset.

## Dataset
The project uses a subset of the CULane dataset [1]. Unfortunately, due to licensing restrictions, we cannot provide the dataset directly in this repository. However, you can download the necessary subset from the official CULane dataset website [1].

## Installation
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```http
  git clone https://github.com/zubeydecivelek/Lane-Detection.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```http
  cd lane-detection
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```http
  pip install
```
